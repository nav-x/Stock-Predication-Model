# Stock-Predication-Model
This project aims to predict stock prices using a hybrid approach combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models. We'll use historical stock price data, perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and then build and evaluate our prediction models.
